Each time I teach my Security class, I give a month-long lab to crack as many passwords as possible.  For this fall's contest [(opened on October 1, 2020)](https://twitter.com/0xmchow/status/1311749343993528322), I used three different hash types: NTLM, MD5, and SHA-512.  The contest closed on November 5th at 11:59 PM PDT.  The password hashes (30 total):

Method â€“ used hashcat mask attacks and hashcat dictionary attacks for
all passwords all while renting a server with many GPU cards Used
Daniel Miessler word lists and weakpass
wordlist. https://vast.ai/console/create/ 10 GTX 1080i server
</pre>

Methodologies from the runners-up who cracked 17 or more passwords:

<pre>I wrote a small python script to read in all of the passwords in
the SecList github, enter them into a set (so no dupes), and then
write them out to one large file. The important part wsa to make sure
the paswords were ordered from smallest lists to largest (to
prioritize the top-x lists over full database dumps). From there I
just ran that list against each set of passwords types on my
rapspberry pi for a few days. I never made it all the way through the
sha passwords, but I didn't want to run for too long.</pre>

<pre>
Methods:
John the Ripper (JtR)
- darkweb2017-top10000.txt (mexico, argentina)
- darkcOde.txt (columbia, tunisia, germany, morocco, portugal)
- xato-net-10-million-passwords.txt (denmark, japan, sweden)
- rockyou.txt (saudiarabia, australia)

Ophcrack (rainbow tables) https://www.objectif-securite.ch/en/ophcrack 
(brazil, costarica, croatia, iceland, nigeria, southkorea)

CrackStation.net
(spain)
</pre>

<pre> Well, I wrote a python script that compiled all the .txt files
in the passwords folder from SecLists into one big .txt file. Then I
just ran hashcat in wordlist mode for all the hashes.</pre>

<pre>I cracked 17 passwords in 5 hours from just the wordlists in
Seclists...

After that, I cracked one password by running a combinator attack and
one more from a breach compilation wordlist that had 1.4 billion
passwords.
</pre>

<pre> I first just ran john the ripper with the rockyou wordlist. I
also explored various other wordlists found from the openwall wordlist
archive. I mixed in no rules and then using all of the default john
rules. I also downloaded all of the KoreLogic word mangling rules, but
have not had much luck with those. I tried different formats with
john, but I've only been able to crack using MD5 & variants, sha512 &
variants, and then using NT format. Tried running incremental mode,
but this did not reveal any new passwords over 3 days of continual
running (expected). Will have to get more creative with word
rules. Trying to set up hashcat to run on GPU, so then I can run some
cracking on my CPU and GPU at the same time for more hashing mwahaha

I also tried to determine all of the hash types, I found that there
are only three types of hashes in this file. MD5crypt, SHA512, and
then either MD5/MD4. Not sure if this is true or not, John says it
detect LM/NT, md5crypt-long, sha512-long, but haven't had any luck
with the long variants.

Using hashcat now, found a few more passwords. Also using larger
wordlists So sad :( I cracked all 19 of these in like the first week
or so, and then didnt have any luck since then. I probably have
50-60gb of wordlists downloaded, was running hashcat full-time on my
friend's PC he wasn't using 24/7 for three weeks, probably used an
amazon P2.xlarge instance with tesla K80 for 72 hours. Nothin. I even
went through and compiled all of the previous passwords you've
released, and pulled out some trends to make custom masks with no
luck. I also just brute forced ?a?a?a?a?a?a?a for md5crypt and NTLM
with no luck beyond what I already had. Can't wait to see all the
passwords released</pre>

<pre>I used rockyou.txt, 29 files from Daniel Miessler's SecLists, and
bruteforce.</pre>

<pre>I used john with various word lists I found on the internet (mostly
github) for groups1 and 2, then used online ophcrack software for
grroup 3</pre>
