<ol>
  <li>
    <p>Your resume was not written well.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>You started your job search too late (most companies now start in the fall, and are all set by the end of fall).  See <a href="/career/2017/06/21/prepare-for-next-summer.html">The Best Thing To Do In Early Summer for Undergraduates: Prepare For Opportunities Next Summer.</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>You blindly applied to everything instead of making an effort to go out and network with a company that is one you know you would legitimately enjoy working with, and demonstrate to them that you’re worth hiring.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>You looked at the wrong places.  The “usual suspects” in your field are never your only options.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If you just applied online, your resume and application probably not read (related to #3 above).</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Your skills did not match the needs of the employer; you have knowledge gaps.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>You have little to no real working experience to show for.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>You have little to no real tangible projects to show for. See <a href="/tech/career/education/2017/01/16/the-importance-of-side-projects.html">Understanding Why Side Projects Are Looked At So Highly in Tech.</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Something came across poorly in your interview including personality, body language, didn’t answer the questions, dress attire, gave canned answers, didn’t ask good questions, seemed dishonest, showed up too early or too late.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>You need more experience working on teams, learning how you can thrive in that environment.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>You didn’t fit the culture, didn’t click.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>You didn’t follow up (within a week). This includes not sending a thank you note after your interview.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>You couldn’t tell or explain your weaknesses or failures.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>You didn’t sign the offer in a reasonable amount of time. An offer is not forever.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>You asked for too much or seemed too needy.</p>
  </li>
</ol>

<p>Last but not least, the worst thing you did: you gave up.</p>
