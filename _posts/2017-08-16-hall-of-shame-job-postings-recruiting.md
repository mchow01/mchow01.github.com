We constantly hear that cyber security has a serious talent shortage.  It doesn't help when job descriptions are completely asinine or when recruiting is embarrassingly bad.  This also goes for the tech industry in general.  After reading these tweets from my friend Ed Rojas, I decided to dedicate a hall of shame to this ongoing problem:

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-lang="en"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">Just read this req on LinkedIn: Masters in cybersecurity + 2 high level certs + Risk Analysis, Ethical Hacking, Incident Response, 1/2</p>&mdash; SilverFox (@EdgarR0jas) <a href="https://twitter.com/EdgarR0jas/status/897529699290800128">August 15, 2017</a></blockquote>

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-lang="en"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">Security architect, BCP/DR, Forensic Analyst, SOC design/implementation. Only reply if you meet all requirements. Seriously????? 2/2</p>&mdash; SilverFox (@EdgarR0jas) <a href="https://twitter.com/EdgarR0jas/status/897529959656194048">August 15, 2017</a></blockquote>

Another purpose of this post is to back up the arguments made in the article: ["There Is No Cyber Talent Crunch; You’re Just Hiring Wrong"](https://www.tripwire.com/state-of-security/risk-based-security-for-executives/connecting-security-to-the-business/there-is-no-cyber-talent-crunch-youre-just-hiring-wrong/) especially the points of "insisting on over-qualified applicants" and over-filtering.  There are many job candidates who ["are feeling utterly demoralized for no reason"](https://twitter.com/AdrianCohea/status/899503146153656321) especially after seeing such job postings.  A message that I want to make clear with this post: don't disqualify yourself --because the purple squirrel does not exist.

### Who the hell are they going to find these jobs on a contract basis? Good luck creating and updating all those documents in six months (thanks to @tcstoolHax0r for this)

### This is for an internship. First, Selenium is misspelled.  Another one of these NDA clowns.  To top it all off: "At present we are exceeding our expectations" --dafuq (thanks to @marsella_h for this)

Perhaps the only statement that is missing from the above posting is:

![We showed great character](/images/we-showed-great-character.jpg)

### There is no such thing as a GIAC Certified Ethical Hacker certification (thanks to @tcstoolHax0r for this)

### I was trying to find evidence of the [job opening that requires 8+ years of Swift experience](https://twitter.com/kevinkaywho/status/898622008019124224) to no avail, but I did find this terribly written job ad for a Senior iOS Developer (10+ years of experience required) but marked as "junior" experience

### ["Third point down. This is what happens when recruiters use buzzwords with no idea what they mean." AWS = Amazon Web Services, Azure belongs to Microsoft (thanks to @CthulhuSec for this)](https://twitter.com/CthulhuSec/status/900318071713398784)

### "They are looking for someone to: lead a team, set up an SDL process, oversee all aspects of security in the cloud infra (This is the devs work if your doing devops right), work within scrum teams (can't evangelize in scrum unless you embed with them), pen testing, 0 days mitigation (by its nature its impossible to mitigate 0days.... because they are 0days), threat assessments, compliance management, dealing with customers, hands on coding????? And they are a manager??? This has 100% burn out job written all over it." (thanks to Toughnuts for this)

### Mother of God! We save the best for last as we hit the jackpot with this one. "Three years as a developer plus 5 years at least in all the other domains. In total ~55 years experience for the optimum candidate." (thanks to @sprkyco for this gem)

# Addendum

My friend Rob Graham wrote this:

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-lang="en"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">Remember: a lot of recruiting posts are designed so that nobody can fill them - except for that one foreigner you&#39;ve already decided to hire</p>&mdash; Rob Graham٩(●̮̮̃●̃) (@ErrataRob) <a href="https://twitter.com/ErrataRob/status/898015231309262848">August 17, 2017</a></blockquote>

While there is truth in what Rob wrote, the problem is when recruiters spam the same job description everywhere (e.g., on LinkedIn) which wastes everyone's time.
