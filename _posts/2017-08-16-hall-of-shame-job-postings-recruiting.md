We constantly hear that cyber security has a serious talent shortage.  It doesn't help when job descriptions are completely asinine or when recruiting is embarrasingly bad.  This also goes for the tech industry in general.  After reading these tweets from my friend Ed Rojas, I decided to dedicate a hall of shame to this ongoing problem:

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-lang="en"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">Just read this req on LinkedIn: Masters in cybersecurity + 2 high level certs + Risk Analysis, Ethical Hacking, Incident Response, 1/2</p>&mdash; SilverFox (@EdgarR0jas) <a href="https://twitter.com/EdgarR0jas/status/897529699290800128">August 15, 2017</a></blockquote>

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-lang="en"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">Security architect, BCP/DR, Forensic Analyst, SOC design/implementation. Only reply if you meet all requirements. Seriously????? 2/2</p>&mdash; SilverFox (@EdgarR0jas) <a href="https://twitter.com/EdgarR0jas/status/897529959656194048">August 15, 2017</a></blockquote>
