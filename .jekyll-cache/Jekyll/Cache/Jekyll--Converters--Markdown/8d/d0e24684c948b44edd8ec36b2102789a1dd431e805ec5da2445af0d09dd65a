I"‰<p>Most colleges and universities will have a fall career fair in either September or October.  This is the more important career fair compared to the spring as <a href="/career/2017/06/21/prepare-for-next-summer.html">many companies / institutions and recruiters are now focusing on the fall career fair and are not going to the spring career fair.</a>  Having visited all career fairs at Tufts since I became a full-time faculty member in 2010 to say hello to old friends, having many former students and friends working at career fairs, having worked at career fairs, and now having a brother working at his alma materâ€™s career fair, most students do career fairs wrong.  Iâ€™ve been wanting to write a sobering career fair piece for a while.  If I had to give a few pieces of sobering advice from the <em>perspective of an employer</em>, here are the common mistakes I see year in and year out.</p>
