I"<p><em>NOTE: I wrote <a href="/tech/career/education/2017/01/16/the-importance-of-side-projects.html">“Understanding Why Side Projects Are Looked At So Highly in Tech”</a> in January 2017.  This is an updated version of the article.  I am no longer using the term “side project” because the term is heavily connotated with Software Engineering.  If you are aiming for a career in Cyber Security, doing Capture The Flag competitions or building a malware lab is equivalent to doing a software side project.  The message is the same for Software Engineering, Program Management, Cyber Security, UI/UX, and countless opportunities: projects outside of the classroom are important.  I am not deleting the original article for referencing and recordkeeping.</em></p>
