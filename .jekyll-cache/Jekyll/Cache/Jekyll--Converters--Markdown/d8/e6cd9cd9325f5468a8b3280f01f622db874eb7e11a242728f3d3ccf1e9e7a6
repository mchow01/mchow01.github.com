I"ã<p>Occasionally, I analyze mobile apps to understand what is really going on behind the scenes knowing that the security and privacy of mobile apps are generally terrible.  I have had the ESPN app on my iPhone for months (<a href="https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/espn/id317469184?mt=8" target="_blank">https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/espn/id317469184?mt=8</a>).  It is no secret that the ESPN website and their native mobile apps are riddled with ads â€“the question is how much ads.  My favorite tool to analyze mobile apps is <code class="highlighter-rouge">mitmproxy</code> (<a href="https://mitmproxy.org/">https://mitmproxy.org/</a>) to examine HTTP and HTTPS traffic.  I was introduced to <code class="highlighter-rouge">mitmproxy</code> by Veracode and Mark Kriegsman back in 2012 when <a href="http://www.veracode.com/blog/2012/02/adios-say-goodbye-to-nosy-iphone-apps" target="_blank">they analyzed which iOS apps were transmitting usersâ€™ address books</a>.  To learn how to set up capturing all HTTP and HTTPS traffic from your iPhone or any mobile device to <code class="highlighter-rouge">mitmproxy</code> running on a computer, <a href="http://www.shubhro.com/2014/12/18/reverse-engineering-kayak-mitmproxy/" target="_blank">here is a good article</a>.  The key is to install the <code class="highlighter-rouge">mitmproxy</code> certificate onto the mobile device (for iOS, see <a href="https://mitmproxy.org/doc/certinstall/ios.html">https://mitmproxy.org/doc/certinstall/ios.html</a>).</p>
