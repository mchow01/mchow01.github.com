I"<p>I run the <a href="https://ase.tufts.edu/icenter/immigration/employment/offCampus_F1_cpt.asp" target="_blank">Curricular Practical Training (CPT)</a> program for international students for the Computer Science Department at Tufts.  This program is necessary for international students to do a summer internship.  As part of getting credit for CPT, I ask each student to write a report addressing: (1) what did student learn technically, (2) what did student learn professionally, (3) what did student wish supervisor(s) did differently, and (4) what would student have done differently.  This summer, there were 18 students in CPT and the reports produced were awesome. Lots of fantastic stories, lessons learned.  The stories illustrate what students are getting out of our curriculum and ultimately in the academic environment, what students are not getting out of our curriculum, and the importance of having professional experience to go along with the academics.  Some gems to share (names and companies, institutions redacted):</p>
