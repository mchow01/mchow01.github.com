        <title>Why You Didn't Get The Job or Opportunity (For College Students)</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;Having worked with a significant number of undergrad and grad students on their job and internship search, and having many conversations with friends and former students, I have compiled a list of the most common reasons why people did not get the job or opportunity (internship or first full-time position after graduation):&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;1. Your resume was not written well.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;2. You started your job search too late (most companies now start in the fall, and are all set by the end of fall).  See &lt;a href=&quot;/career/2017/06/21/prepare-for-next-summer.html&quot;&gt;The Best Thing To Do In Early Summer for Undergraduates: Prepare For Opportunities Next Summer.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;3. You blindly applied to everything instead of making an effort to go out and network with a company that is one you know you would legitimately enjoy working with, and demonstrate to them that you're worth hiring.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;4. You looked at the wrong places.  The &quot;usual suspects&quot; in your field are never your only options.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;5. If you just applied online, your resume and application was probably not read (related to #3 above).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;6. Your skills did not match the needs of the employer; you have knowledge gaps.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;7. You have little to no real working experience to show for.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;8. You have little to no real tangible projects to show for. See &lt;a href=&quot;/tech/career/education/2017/01/16/the-importance-of-side-projects.html&quot;&gt;Understanding Why Side Projects Are Looked At So Highly in Tech.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;9. Something came across poorly in your interview including personality, body language, didn't answer the questions, dress attire, gave canned answers, didn't ask good questions, seemed dishonest, showed up too early or too late.  More:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;You came across as privileged or arrogant or overconfident; on the other side of that coin too timid or unconfident.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;You were unable to articulate what you want to do (sounding like you would take anything, anywhere is a bad strategy).&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;You didn’t do a good job of researching the organization and/or could not articulate why you wanted to work at that particular company.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;You couldn’t demonstrate what you would bring to the party that would be relevant to the position.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;You plan to only stay at an organization for less than a few years and you told them that.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;10. You need more experience working on teams, learning how you can thrive in that environment.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;11. You didn't fit the culture, didn't click.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;12. You didn't follow up (within a week). This includes not sending a thank you note after your interview.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;13. You couldn't tell your weaknesses or failures.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;14. You didn't sign the offer in a reasonable amount of time. An offer is not forever.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;15. You asked for too much or seemed too needy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Last but not least, the worst thing you did: you gave up.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;sup&gt;Special acknowledgements to Mark Bouchard, Robin Kahan, and Winnona DeSombre as some of the items were taken from them, word-for-word.&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Results of a Password Cracking Contest for My Security Class (Spring 2018)</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;Each time I teach my Security class, I give a month-long lab to crack as many passwords as possible.  For this spring’s contest &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/0xmchow/status/967850845042806784&quot;&gt;(opened on February 25, 2018&lt;/a&gt;), I used three different hash types: NTLM, MD5, and SHA-512.  The password hashes:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The winner cracked 12 of the passwords.  The student’s haul:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;
edrojas:L!verp00l        Using hashcat, a and rockyou
chicagoduke:v5a1            
cozyduke:M6E3                 Using hashcat, rockyou, and OneRule
cacaduke:zr4LmK          Hashcat, mask attack on ?a?a?a?a?a?a
pandaduke:tmann16       Hashcat, dic attack using realhuman_phill.txt
grizzlyduke:wardere   
blackduke:123kat        Using hashcat and Rockyou dictionary
smokeyduke:8nfJ                Using hashcat mask on ?a?a?a?a
cocoduke:tLUR
yetiduke:ferraro        Hashcat, dic attack using realhuman_phill.txt
edrojasagain:HumanHorn        Rainbow cracks on a large downloaded table
teddyduke:Yj-4@!k
&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The student’s methodology:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;I started off looking at the password cracking contest from previous years, ran all the hashes through the rockyou dictionary, and then used rule sets. I ending up trying some masks and a huge password list because I was stuck, and finally I tried out rainbow cracks because I hadn’t gotten a ton of hits on the NTLM.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Looking at password cracking contest from previous years was very very smart!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The student’s methodology:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Mostly dictionary attacks using hashcat on my GPU; I ran john for quite a while on CPU in parallel, but it didn’t manage to get any of the passwords.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;Wordlists that produced a lot of passwords:&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;ul&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;rockyou&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;HashesOrg&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;Also used phpbb, top1000000, Nummer_DB
Rule sets that produced a lot of passwords:&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;OneRuleToRuleThemAll (https://github.com/NotSoSecure/password_cracking_rules)&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;d3adhob0 (https://github.com/praetorian-inc/Hob0Rules)&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;best64 and hob064&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;/ul&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;A few of the passwords came from brute force, which I ran on NTLM and MD5 because it was fairly fast for short passwords, and on 4 character passwords with SHA512 because I got a couple of them from HashesOrg and took a guess that there might be more, given that (for the other passwords I had cracked) many of the passwords within a given hash function were of the same length.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;Overall conclusions: good hash functions and salting don’t fix bad passwords, but they do help – the 4-character SHA512 passwords would have been trivial to break if they were hashed with NTLM (or even MD5), but they ended up being some of the last ones I cracked.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;Exact notes about what managed to crack each of the hashes, in (roughly) the order in which I cracked them:&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Students' Summer Internship Reports, In Their Own Words</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;I run the &lt;a href=&quot;https://ase.tufts.edu/icenter/immigration/employment/offCampus_F1_cpt.asp&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Curricular Practical Training (CPT)&lt;/a&gt; program for international students for the Computer Science Department at Tufts.  This program is necessary for international students to do a summer internship.  As part of getting credit for CPT, I ask each student to write a report addressing: (1) what did student learn technically, (2) what did student learn professionally, (3) what did student wish supervisor(s) did differently, and (4) what would student have done differently.  This summer, there were 18 students in CPT and the reports produced were awesome. Lots of fantastic stories, lessons learned.  The stories illustrate what students are getting out of our curriculum and ultimately in the academic environment, what students are not getting out of our curriculum, and the importance of having professional experience to go along with the academics.  Some gems to share (names and companies, institutions redacted):&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;“I also realized that I liked the freedom of open-ended problems a lot more than problems in class. My supervisor would explain the problem to me, would give me pointers as to where to start looking at and give me some of the initial ideas he had. But he left much of the engineering to me. I got used to just experimenting my ideas, which felt more motivating.”&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;“Although I could never had known this at the start of my internship, I do wish that I was used to reading research papers.”&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;“One of my first mistakes was to think that the supervisor expected me to know everything beforehand and that asking questions was something to be ashamed of.”&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;“As such, I was unprepared for the practical knowledge that went into and the scale of [redacted] infrastructure and tooling. On the first day, my team members rattled off no less than five different systems that they were maintaining”&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;“Secondly, I developed my communication skills and understood the importance of communication both at a work-related and non-work-related level.”&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;“Next, I learned that I should not expect my supervisor or manager to give me all the instructions I need”&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;“I also learned to not feel ashamed when asking the person who wrote the code you are working with how it works.”&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;“…the first thing to do in creating an application is to make it work first and then optimization should come later.”&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;“I would have taken some more breaks this summer. As this internship is wrapping up I’ve been completing some of the final touches to my projects but I can’t help but feel a little burned out.”&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;“First off how important it is to enjoy your workplace culture and the companionship of your colleagues. I am very fortunate to be able to work with people that bring a smile onto my face everyday and laughter into the workplace.”&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;“And by having someone professionally QA my work, made me realized the importance of the safety of the code, and never ever trust user’s input.”&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;“The only feedback that I have received was when I explicitly asked to meet and to discuss about how I’m doing.”&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;“The working process promotes the heavy use of the revision control software Git, with which each developer works on different feature branches for different projects before having their code meticulously reviewed by various members of the team for quality check and then sent to the Quality Assurance team for testing.”&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;“I also learned to ask relevant and timely questions so as to facilitate my initial learning process without delaying the work of my supervisor and coworkers.”&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;“On the job, no one but myself could be my teacher.”&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;“I wish my supervisor could use less jargons and more plain English when he answered my questions.”&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;“It is important to keep focus on your own project, but it is equally important to get known more about your colleagues’ projects. I think this could help me find more things I feel interested about.”&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;“I wish I could have gone over the [redacted] API documentation more thoroughly before I started working on the app”&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;“I also wish I could have asked more of my coworkers’ help”&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;“How to engage with and seek help from anyone who might know more about something than I do.”&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“I wish I had a chance to discuss the results with my advisor or collaborators from medical poi_nt of view. I believe this step was necessary to validate the result of the project. Networking with more people in my research field is another item I can mention as an important aspect of the internship that I wish I had worked on more.”_&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;“I hope I could design the project clearly first, and make sure I understand every part, then start writing code.”&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;“Besides just writing code, I have also had regular meetings with both my supervisors and my clients from the Recruitment Department to showcase, discuss, and improve on existing features and create a better user’s experience. What I have realized through those meetings is that effective communication is essential to any successful project.”&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;“Moreover, I wish I could have asked for help more often than trying to solve some problem by myself for a long time, as I could have been problem-solving more efficiently.”&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;“Thus, I learned that I should be always ready to presenting my work to others.”&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;“Communicating your ideas is very important to work in a team.”&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Hall of Shame Job Postings and Recruiting</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;We constantly hear that cyber security has a serious talent shortage.  It doesn’t help when job descriptions are completely asinine or when recruiting is embarrassingly bad.  This also goes for the tech industry in general.  After reading these tweets from my friend Ed Rojas, I decided to dedicate a hall of shame to this ongoing problem:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote class=&quot;twitter-tweet&quot; data-lang=&quot;en&quot;&gt;&lt;p lang=&quot;en&quot; dir=&quot;ltr&quot;&gt;Just read this req on LinkedIn: Masters in cybersecurity + 2 high level certs + Risk Analysis, Ethical Hacking, Incident Response, 1/2&lt;/p&gt;&amp;mdash; SilverFox (@EdgarR0jas) &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/EdgarR0jas/status/897529699290800128&quot;&gt;August 15, 2017&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote class=&quot;twitter-tweet&quot; data-lang=&quot;en&quot;&gt;&lt;p lang=&quot;en&quot; dir=&quot;ltr&quot;&gt;Security architect, BCP/DR, Forensic Analyst, SOC design/implementation. Only reply if you meet all requirements. Seriously????? 2/2&lt;/p&gt;&amp;mdash; SilverFox (@EdgarR0jas) &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/EdgarR0jas/status/897529959656194048&quot;&gt;August 15, 2017&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Another purpose of this post is to back up the arguments made in the article: &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.tripwire.com/state-of-security/risk-based-security-for-executives/connecting-security-to-the-business/there-is-no-cyber-talent-crunch-youre-just-hiring-wrong/&quot;&gt;“There Is No Cyber Talent Crunch; You’re Just Hiring Wrong”&lt;/a&gt; especially the points of “insisting on over-qualified applicants” and over-filtering.  There are many job candidates who &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/AdrianCohea/status/899503146153656321&quot;&gt;“are feeling utterly demoralized for no reason”&lt;/a&gt; especially after seeing such job postings.  A message that I want to make clear with this post: don’t disqualify yourself –because the purple squirrel does not exist.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&quot;addendum&quot;&gt;Addendum&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My friend Rob Graham wrote this:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote class=&quot;twitter-tweet&quot; data-lang=&quot;en&quot;&gt;&lt;p lang=&quot;en&quot; dir=&quot;ltr&quot;&gt;Remember: a lot of recruiting posts are designed so that nobody can fill them - except for that one foreigner you&amp;#39;ve already decided to hire&lt;/p&gt;&amp;mdash; Rob Graham٩(●̮̮̃●̃) (@ErrataRob) &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/ErrataRob/status/898015231309262848&quot;&gt;August 17, 2017&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While there is truth in what Rob wrote, the problem is when recruiters spam the same job description everywhere (e.g., on LinkedIn) which wastes everyone’s time.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Results of a Password Cracking Contest for My Online Security Class (Summer 2017)</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;I offered my &lt;a href=&quot;https://tuftsdev.github.io/DefenseAgainstTheDarkArts&quot;&gt;Introduction to Computer Security&lt;/a&gt; class as an online course for the first time.  I give a month-long summer lab to crack as many passwords as possible.  For this summer’s contest &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/0xmchow/status/882073476886089731&quot;&gt;(opened on July 3, 2017&lt;/a&gt;), I used three different hash types: NTLM, MD5, and SHA-512.  The password hashes:&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>The Best Thing To Do In Early Summer for Undergraduates: Prepare For Opportunities Next Summer</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;One of the best thing undergraduates can do in the early summer: prepare for the opportunity next summer –whether you currently have an internship / research opportunity or not.  There is no substitute for real experience.  Experience and track record are paramount for any opportunity from first full-time opportunity out of college to senior-level position. &lt;em&gt;How can people trust you and your work when you have little or nothing to show for?&lt;/em&gt;  Case-in-point, on Turner Construction’s website:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.turnerconstruction.com/careers/recruits/internship&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;&lt;em&gt;“In today’s competitive professional world, the most qualified job candidates have more than classroom experience. They leave college and enter the workforce with hands-on exposure in their chosen fields. Turner places high value on internship experience when making hiring decisions.&lt;/em&gt;”&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My career advice to undergraduate students is to get experience early and often.  Chantel McCabe said it best: &lt;a href=&quot;https://issuu.com/tnhstaff/docs/issue_24&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;&lt;em&gt;“I interned every single semester. No classroom curriculum can replace the lessons you learn by doing and interacting. The most difficult part is getting acclimated: knowing where to go and who to go to for what and feeling comfortable.”&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;  Many undergraduates do not realize the enormous payoff of working and gaining experience early including higher pay and retroactive accrual of benefits.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you currently have an internship, you already have an advantage but that does not mean you should be too comfortable.  If you have already made an impact and people around you know it, good chance you will be offered a full-time opportunity after graduation or be asked to return next summer.  I have even seen undergraduates being asked to quit school and work full-time.  This is a good time to ask yourself a few important questions:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Do you see yourself continuing the work that you are doing?&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Do you like the people who you are working with?&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;If offered the opportunity to return next summer, would you stay?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If graduate school is on your radar for the future, another consideration is to do summer research via Research Experience for Undergraduates (REU).  That will give you first hand research experience, perhaps a publication opportunity which will give you a significant advantage over other graduate school applicants in the future, and you will still get to build stuff.  Example: my friend and colleague Ben Shapiro at the University of Colorado, Boulder currently have two summer REU students building a framework for real-time machine learning in browser, using web-Bluetooth to get input from tangible devices.  That skillset is incredibly valuable for future opportunities, industry or academia.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you currently do not have an internship, early summer is the perfect time to start preparing for your search for opportunities for next summer.  Action items on how to take advantage of the time that you have:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;1. &lt;strong&gt;Go to meetups and networking events (this also include conferences).&lt;/strong&gt;  The warm weather makes way for more events.  The importance of networking events:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;You meet people who could be your future employer.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;You meet people who are like you and perhaps in the same situation as you are.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;You meet people in the field you are interested in getting into and what the community is like.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;You can listen to similar or different perspectives and ideas. For example, if you have an idea for a side project, someone may tell you the pitfalls or proceeding with the idea.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;You have the opportunity learn something.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;(Side note: my friend Greg Raiz runs Drinks On Tap.  &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.meetup.com/DrinksOnTap/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Drinks On Tap is a social meet up for the mobile developer community.&lt;/a&gt;  If you want to get into Cyber Security, there is the &lt;a href=&quot;/security/2015/07/19/security-summer-camp.html&quot;&gt;trio of infamous conferences in Las Vegas a.k.a., summer security camp&lt;/a&gt;.)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;2. &lt;strong&gt;Start making a list companies that you want to talk to at a fall career fair.&lt;/strong&gt;  While you may not know who will be at the fall career fair, you can base it on the list of institutions and companies at the previous year's fall career fair.  Many companies / institutions and recruiters are now only focusing on the fall career fair and not going to the spring career fair.  The reason: competition for talent is fierce and companies / institutions want to fill their summer slots early with the best possible talents.  Alas, I hear many students say that when they went to the spring career fair, it was slim pickings.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;3. &lt;strong&gt;Keep yourself busy.&lt;/strong&gt;  If you receive an interview for an opportunity for next summer and your resume has gaps, you can bet you will be asked the question or something of-the-like: &quot;What did you do last summer?&quot;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;4. &lt;strong&gt;If you are in tech, learn something, build something.&lt;/strong&gt; There is absolutely no excuse to not take advantage of the opportunities, tools, technologies, and resources that are available and accessible. The points of learning something are to build your skills and to demonstrate to others that you can learn new technologies quickly. There is a concern from many Computer Science undergraduates that they must work on a side project: that is not what I am saying here.  Working on a side project for the sake of putting a side project on your resume is not a good thing, but there is absolutely no excuse to not learn or dabble with something.  Chances are, the small learning project that you do (e.g., a simple Facebook login button using the Facebook API or listing all your Spotify playlists using the Spotify API) will give you more ideas for an even bigger project.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Whether you currently have an opportunity or not, the moral of the story is &lt;em&gt;the early bird catches the worm&lt;/em&gt;.  Not understanding that timeless advice and you will be behind the eight ball after graduation –if it wasn’t bad enough already due to student loan debt.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Of Personal Note to Tufts Computer Science Students and Alumni</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;While I cannot speak for the entire Computer Science Department, we cannot thank you and others enough for the outpouring of support that you and countless alumni have showed to both Ben Hescott and to Tufts Computer Science Department.  We are very grateful and it means a tremendous lot to us.  I am in awe and I’m sure Ben will be eternally grateful for all the support.  For those who do not know, &lt;a href=&quot;https://medium.com/@ashley.hedberg/a-response-to-ben-hescotts-denied-tenure-121657a23fc3&quot;&gt;Ben was denied tenure&lt;/a&gt;.  During the last several weeks, it became crystal clear that Tufts Computer Science has a very strong and dedicated student and alumni network especially those who have graduated within the last six to seven years.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It is no surprise that I have received a lot of questions from concerned and distraught students and alumni.  Examples, word for word:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;“So, I’m curious, will other professors be following Ben in leaving Tufts?”&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;“So I’ve a rather blunt question for you: how fucked is this department?”&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;“you’re usually the first person to tweet about something. Any reason you haven’t here? Not that I’m saying you should or anything, just wondering if you know something that the rest of us don’t.”&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;1. &lt;strong&gt;Very important:&lt;/strong&gt; do &lt;em&gt;not&lt;/em&gt; direct your anger or thoughts to Kathleen Fisher, the Chair of the Tufts Computer Science Department, to the Department of Computer Science, or to the School of Engineering. They have been very supportive of Ben and to us, and they played no part in this decision.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;2. I would be delighted to take all of Ben's undergraduate advisees.  I have started writing to some of Ben's advisees.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;3. Regarding the questions &quot;So...&quot;, I was frank and listed the immediate ramifications which should come at no surprise to anyone, namely:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Angry students and undergrads; also will affect enrollment.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Donations from alumni especially from Computer Science will be negatively impacted.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Loss of service to the University as Ben did quite a lot for the University.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;4. I cannot control the thoughts or actions of others.  What I can assure you: I am not leaving in 2017-2018 as (1) I want to see the Class of 2018 graduate and (2) we're not morale worse than it is now.  We have four new faculty members starting in fall 2017 and we have some cool stuff going on in robotics, cyber security and policy, and machine learning.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;5. The reason why I haven't said anything public in the past few weeks: if there is nothing good to say, don't say anything at all.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Losing Ben is no different than losing a close family member or friend.   Ben set the bar so high for everyone in the Department and at Tufts. I can never thank Ben enough for that, and I am very grateful to have learned so much from him over the years.  Those teaching awards that I received this year and last year can be attributed to Ben and to a few others.  Not a single day goes by where I do not ask myself: “what if I had Ben Hescott or Norman Ramsey as a professor at Tufts?”  That I will never know but I’m sure my life would have been even better.  Don’t worry, Ben is taken care of and he will do very well at Northeastern –they are very lucky to have him.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Kathleen Fisher and I know how important alumni relationships are.  There is a good reason why we have been throwing get-togethers at Meadhall for the last several years: to continue building the relationship with our own alumni.  But we need to do more now.  The last several weeks have really woke up many (students, faculty, and alumni) on how powerful our alums can be and why is it important it is for us to continue developing those relationship after graduation.  Why do you think I bring back alums to give guest lectures and talks?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There will never be another Ben Hescott and no one can ever replace Ben Hescott at Tufts.  A fantastic colleague wrote: “I understand the impulse to vote with your wallet. But I’m not sure that’s what Ben would want.  He sent the faculty a very nice letter yesterday, and he treasures his time here. I think he would not want students and alumni to sever their connections in his name.”  This is not the end.  We all need to step up more now, in some way or another.  I’m sure Ben would be delighted to see that in his name.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;P.S., You may be wondering why I did not post this on Facebook.  First, I am not on Facebook.  Second, Facebook is not an open platform: link to a Facebook post or gallery and you will be asked to log in or create a Facebook account.  Third, Facebook posts are not indexed, searchable via search engines other than Facebook.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;P.P.S., You may be wondering why I am posting this publicly.  The reason: it is absolutely necessary to communicate to our students that we were not the ones responsible for this decision.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>The BSides Boston 2017 Breaking Into InfoSec Panel Questions</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;At the BSides Boston 2017 Security Conference held at Harvard University’s Science Center, there was an afternoon panel “Breaking Into infosec.”  The invited panelists: Tracy Z. Maleeff, Justin Pagano, and myself.  The moderator was Keith Hoodlet.  The abstract of the panel as written on the &lt;a href=&quot;https://bsidesboston2017.sched.com/event/9xRn/panel-breaking-into-infosec&quot;&gt;schedule&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Are you interested in Information Security, but you don’t know where to start? Are you a professional in another field, wanting to switch into Information Security? Or maybe you’re a Security Professional looking to make a move, andwant to know what hiring managers are looking for. In this panel we will cover various topics for sheperding your career in Information Security from three different perspectives. The panelists - including an educator, a recent convert, and a hiring manager - will field a series of questions on topics including:&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;What skills are employers looking for?&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;What resources are students currently leveraging?&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;How can you get involved in Security (even if it’s outside your current role)?… and any other questions you might have!&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We had a fantastic time on the panel.  Sadly, the panel was only an hour long and we did not answer all the planned questions or answer any questions from the audience.  The panel could have continued for a very long time.  Before the conference, panelists were given a list of ten questions to prepare for: Keith wrote the questions (thanks again Keith).  Only six of the questions were asked in the panel due to limited time.  Here were the ten questions that were planned and my response to each question:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;question-1&quot;&gt;Question 1:&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;(To Tracy) What have you found to be the biggest challenge for entering into the industry?&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;(To Justin) What have you found to be the biggest challenge in hiring for the industry?&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;(To Me) What have you found to be the biggest challenge in preparing students for the industry?&lt;/strong&gt;
    &lt;ul&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;Working on open-ended problems.  I am appalled by how students are generally uncomfortable with working on unstructured and open-ended problems. The problem becomes glaring during students’ first internships as I constantly see comments in Curricular Practical Training (CPT) reports such as “I wish my supervisors had described the overall structure in a little more detail” or “I was simply freaking out with the fact that I did not have an assignment with a roadmap.” That’s normal and reality. Generally speaking in the real world, you will not be given detailed specifications as in most academic classes.&lt;/li&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;Get students to talk through vague and open-ended problems.&lt;/li&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;Getting them to get experience early and often. There is no substitute for real work experience.&lt;/li&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;No hand-holding (I do not do that).&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;/ul&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;question-2&quot;&gt;Question 2:&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;(To Tracy) What skills have you focused on developing for building your career?&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;(To Justin) What skills are you looking to hire for?&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;(To Me) What skill are students focusing on learning today?&lt;/strong&gt;
    &lt;ul&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;Taking responsibility for one’s own learning; college is not an end.&lt;/li&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;I did not take a course in web development, mobile development, or security when I was an undergrad (1998-2002).&lt;/li&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;Reading&lt;/li&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;Writing&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;/ul&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;question-3&quot;&gt;Question 3:&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;(To Tracy) What resources have you found useful in preparing for job interviews?&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;(To Justin) What resources does your team leverage on a regular basis?&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;(To Me) What resources are students leveraging to develop their skills?&lt;/strong&gt;
    &lt;ul&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://news.ycombinator.com/&quot;&gt;Hacker News: https://news.ycombinator.com/&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;Nick Davis, Rapid7 (he took my Security course in fall 2013, Tufts Class of 2014)&lt;/li&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;Sarah Gibson, Veracode (she took my Security course in fall 2016)&lt;/li&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;Me&lt;/li&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;Guest speakers and alumni network&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;/ul&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;question-4-not-asked-in-the-panel&quot;&gt;Question 4 (not asked in the panel):&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;(To Tracy) As you started your career, what did you do to get involved in Security?&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;(To Justin) What are some of the ways internal personal can help amplify the Security message in the workkplace?&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;(To Me) What are your students doing to be involved in the Security Community?&lt;/strong&gt;
    &lt;ul&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;Personal Engagement Project in my Cyber Security and Cyber Warfare course (a joint Computer Science and Political Science course this semester)&lt;/li&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;What: Because Cyber Security is a very broad field that encompasses many disciplines and changes rapidly, we expect every student in the class to participate in ways not explicitly defined by the curriculum and syllabus.&lt;/li&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;Why: We want our students to be strong in: (1) taking responsibility for one’s own learning, (2) actively engaging with a larger community outside the classroom (e.g., a professional group), (3) be active citizens, and (4) work on an open-ended project. Cyber Security presents many opportunities outside the classroom&lt;/li&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;We can’t teach everything about Cyber Security in this class nor can we show all the opportunities that are out there.&lt;/li&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;We want to give students’ the flexibility and freedom to pursue to explore what is out there with regards to Cyber Security.&lt;/li&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;We want to grow students’ intellectual curiosity and make you take responsibility of your own learning.&lt;/li&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;We want to see students engaged with the community in some capacity outside of the classroom –that’s where the real learning is.&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;/ul&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;question-5&quot;&gt;Question 5:&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;(To Tracy) Have you pursued certifications as a mechanism for growing your career? Why or why not?&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;(To Justin) When reviewing resumes, do you find that you’re more likely to interview someone with a certification? Why or why not?&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;(To Me) Do you encourage your students to pursue additional certifications? Why or Why Not?&lt;/strong&gt;
    &lt;ul&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;Ask yourself: do you need it? (thanks to Peter Sullivan back in 2007).  Some jobs (e.g., working at the Department of Defense) require certifications.&lt;/li&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;The dubious value of some certifications is well documented.&lt;/li&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/Viss/status/851912114008498176&quot;&gt;@viss: “2 people who know their shit and did “real work” before infosec can do 100x more than 5 cissps with zero experience.” Source: https://twitter.com/Viss/status/851912114008498176&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;I advocate for the SANS Institute because I am an alumnus and I am very grateful for what I got out of the SANS SEC504 course (GCIH certified from 2007-2011).  I give each student in my Security class a SANS poster before the CTF game.&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;/ul&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;question-6-what-transferable-non-infosec-skills-have-you-find-to-be-assets-within-the-security-industry&quot;&gt;Question 6: What transferable non-infosec skills have you find to be assets within the security industry?&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I worked at Harvard for ten years at the Department of Environmental Health &amp;amp; Safety (EH&amp;amp;S).  Looking back, I am now more grateful for working there.  The reasons:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;I was the only tech person in the Department.  Thus, I had to communicate to mostly non-technical personnel.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;I learned the business context of Environmental Health &amp;amp; Safety (EH&amp;amp;S).  I applied my technical knowledge to build tools to support the Department, most of those tools are now still in production.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;I was exposed to the importance of industrial hygiene, occupational safety, and public health.  As Chris Wysopal once said to me, something along the lines of: “you can’t graduate from a Civil and Environmental Engineering program without learning about health and safety but you can graduate from a Computer Science program without learning learning about security, hygiene, and safety.”  Alas, we are still facing the same issues we have for the last decades.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;question-7-what-standards-or-practices-do-you-see-other-fields-using-that-you-think-infosec-could-benefit-from-adopting-not-asked-in-the-panel&quot;&gt;Question 7: What standards or practices do you see other fields using that you think infosec could benefit from adopting? (not asked in the panel)&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;A standard glossary of terms.  There is still a vocabulary problem in this field.  The problem is compounded when working with policymakers and non-tech folks. A good read: &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.syssec-project.eu/m/page-media/3/zanero_login.pdf&quot;&gt;“Why Offensive Security Needs Engineering Textbooks” by Sergey Bratus, Ivan Arce, and Michael Locasto (USENIX ;login: August 2014)&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Professional Engineers (PE) exam.  A good read: &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.theatlantic.com/technology/archive/2015/11/programmers-should-not-call-themselves-engineers/414271/&quot;&gt;“Programmers: Stop Calling Yourselves Engineers” https://www.theatlantic.com/technology/archive/2015/11/programmers-should-not-call-themselves-engineers/414271/&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;question-8-how-important-is-it-that-individuals-participate-in-extra-curricular-activities-to-expand-their-knowledge-and-build-their-resume-not-asked-in-the-panel&quot;&gt;Question 8: How important is it that individuals participate in extra-curricular activities to expand their knowledge and build their resume? (not asked in the panel)&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;HUGE. Examples: &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.atlanticcouncil.org/programs/brent-scowcroft-center/cyber-statecraft/cyber-9-12&quot;&gt;Atlantic Council Cyber 9/12 Student Competition&lt;/a&gt; (Josh Corman is the Director), &lt;a href=&quot;http://mitrecyberacademy.org/competitions/embedded/&quot;&gt;MITRE Embedded Capture The Flag Competition&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;https://builditbreakit.org/&quot;&gt;Build It Break It Fix It&lt;/a&gt; .  Not only for the open-ended problems but also for the networking alone.  Real work experience and &lt;a href=&quot;/tech/career/education/2017/01/16/the-importance-of-side-projects.html&quot;&gt;projects are paramount&lt;/a&gt;. One will learn as much from the competitions, if not more, than in the classroom.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;question-9-in-your-opinion-what-is-the-most-valuable-skill-to-develop-or-posses-to-be-successful-in-information-security-not-asked-in-the-panel&quot;&gt;Question 9: In your opinion, what is the most valuable skill to develop or posses to be successful in Information Security? (not asked in the panel)&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Communications and empathy.  I’ve seen it first hand what happens when someone does not communicate well.  Problems ripples down, affects others.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;question-10-what-parting-wisdom-do-you-want-to-share-for-those-that-want-to-break-into-infosec&quot;&gt;Question 10: What parting wisdom do you want to share for those that want to break into infosec?&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GTt3qvdTexM&quot;&gt;The same message from BSides Boston 2014: security is a lifestyle.&lt;/a&gt;  In other words, you have to be passionate.  Too many people are in it for the parties and money.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Understanding Why Side Projects Are Looked At So Highly in Tech</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;It is no secret that tech companies place high value on side or non-classroom projects when making hiring decisions.  Most of the top companies including Google &lt;sup&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#ref1&quot;&gt;1&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; and Facebook &lt;sup&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#ref2&quot;&gt;2&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; will not even consider you if you do not show any side projects.  Many students have asked me why side projects are so highly valued by tech companies for internships and full-time opportunities in tech.  Let’s delve into understanding the importance of side projects for tech opportunities.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Interviews can only go so far.&lt;/strong&gt;  Interviews can reveal your competency in a subject area, but they do not reveal your natural interest in building stuff, ability to learn quickly, or ability to work on something for a long time.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Having a side project will open up a deeper and engaging conversation.&lt;/strong&gt;  Peeking at examples of code someone has written and shared reveals a lot.  A question I always ask candidates is something along the lines of: “tell me about a project that you have worked on” &lt;sup&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#ref3&quot;&gt;3&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;.  This is where I can assess candidate’s ability to analyze costs and trade-offs, remark about programming style, passion, personality, and even assess writing abilities.  A fantastic outcome of such conversation is if both the candidate and I learn something from each other.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Side projects demonstrate your ability to build, your ability to apply what you have learned overall (e.g., in a Computer Science curriculum), and that you actually know how to program. [A bonus is if someone can build something completely with documentation, tests, bugfixes, etc.]&lt;/strong&gt;  Especially for software engineering roles, companies look for builders, hackers, the hands-on and creative types.  The building, hacking, creative, and hands-on skills are generally not reflected in the classroom setting.  Students have been trained all their life to do homework assignments, take tests, and perhaps aim to get top grades for classes.  The aim of homework assignments is to apply recent concepts learned and most assignments are one-offs.  Tests, quizzes, and certifications almost never show anything about a person’s hands-on abilities.  This cycle does not reflect how the real world works.  For most, there are not enough opportunities in the academic setting to put-it-all-together.  Sadly, the result is many students graduate with a Computer Science degree but do not feel they know how to program as evident by &lt;a href=&quot;http://softwareengineering.stackexchange.com/questions/43528/im-graduating-with-a-computer-science-degree-but-i-dont-feel-like-i-know-how-t/&quot;&gt;this sobering discussion on StackExchange&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Side projects demonstrate your ability to learn on your own and dabble with new tools and technologies.&lt;/strong&gt;  Compared to when I was a Computer Science student in the Dot-com days, there is now a plethora of JavaScript and web frameworks, Machine Learning packages, security tools, microcontrollers, databases, integrated development environments (IDEs), and the list goes on.  The barrier and cost of entry for the technologies are very low.  There is a massive collection of resources (e.g., documentation, examples, courseware) available on the Internet.  There are even communities (e.g., meet-ups) and conferences for special interest and topics.  What is certain: (1) there will be more technologies and frameworks released in the future, and (2) you will be asked to work on something using technologies you are not familiar with.  It is very difficult to keep up with the pace of technology and innovation.  The technology or framework that you are using today may be obsolete tomorrow.  You need to demonstrate your value and your ability to adapt quickly.  I didn’t take a course in web development when I was an undergraduate, and I didn’t take a course in mobile development (it didn’t even exist): I had to learn them on the job and on my spare time back in-the-days.  This is especially important if you want to delve into security: most college and certification courses do not “provide all of the skills and practical experience needed to become a desirable candidate for an entry level position” &lt;sup&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#ref4&quot;&gt;4&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; and I wholeheartedly agree with Lesley Carhart on this.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Side projects demonstrate drive, passion, self-motivation, and the ability to work on unstructured problems.&lt;/strong&gt;  This is the complete the opposite of assignments in an academic setting: the problem is defined (sometimes too defined), the answer(s) are known in advance.  This is a reason why classroom projects listed on a résumé hold little to no weight.  I’ve been appalled by how students are generally uncomfortable with working on unstructured and open-ended problems. The problem becomes glaring during students’ first internships as I constantly see comments in Curricular Practical Training (CPT) reports such as “I wish my supervisors had described the overall structure in a little more detail” or “I was simply freaking out with the fact that I did not have an assignment with a roadmap.” My response is always: “welcome to reality.”  The professional world “is unstructured, with competing priorities and decisions that need to be made on the fly. College is very task-based: take an exam, finish a paper, attend a club meeting, go to practice. The workplace is more of a mash-up of activities with no scheduled end.” &lt;sup&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#ref5&quot;&gt;5&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Side projects help build your track record and portfolio.&lt;/strong&gt;  There is a number of people who started coding or programming very recently because of the push and many initiatives to learn programming including bootcamps, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.whitehouse.gov/blog/2016/01/30/computer-science-all&quot;&gt;White House’s Computer Science For All&lt;/a&gt;.  One of the worst-kept secrets in the last few years is the number of students who are majoring in Computer Science because that’s “where the money and opportunities are” or because “mommy and daddy told me to major in Computer Science because that’s where the money and opportunities are.”  Alas, this is a major reason for the exploding demand in Computer Science education.  You will not and cannot learn everything in classroom, it is impossible.  Just doing the bare minimum coursework is not enough to get you opportunities.  Experience and track record are paramount for any opportunity from first full-time opportunity out of college to senior-level position.  &lt;em&gt;How can people trust you and your work when you have little or nothing to show for?&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you do not want to put in the effort to go the extra mile, &lt;em&gt;someone else already has and that person ate your lunch&lt;/em&gt;.  The amount of available tools, technologies, and frameworks now is massive and accessible.  A few years ago over lunch, my friend &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/jeffseibert&quot;&gt;Jeff Seibert&lt;/a&gt; said two words that still resonates: &lt;em&gt;no excuse&lt;/em&gt; –there is absolutely no excuse to not take advantage of the opportunities, tools, technologies, and resources that are available and accessible.  While it is impossible to learn everything that is available, there is absolutely no excuse to not learn something.&lt;/p&gt;
