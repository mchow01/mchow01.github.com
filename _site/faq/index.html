    <h3 id="can-you-give-me-some-tips-on-preparing-for-a-technical-job-interview--do-you-also-have-a-list-of-typical-interview-questions">Can you give me some tips on preparing for a technical job interview?  Do you also have a list of typical interview questions?</h3>

<p>First things first, be yourself.  Here are some questions I, and many good interviewers, will ask:</p>

<ul>
  <li><em>Tell me about yourself.</em> A dreaded and open-ended question.  The purposes of this question are to see if the candidate has a pulse, can communicate clearly, is prepared at all, and more importantly, interest in the job and the company.</li>
  <li>Technical stuff:
    <ul>
      <li>This gem: <a href="http://www.codinghorror.com/blog/2007/02/why-cant-programmers-program.html" target="_blank">http://www.codinghorror.com/blog/2007/02/why-cant-programmers-program.html</a>.  The reasoning for this question: to check if the candidate can actually program. You do not believe how many people interview for a programming-related job but, well, don’t know how to program! Last spring, a number of students thanked me for stressing this question as this question was asked on their interviews.</li>
      <li>Given a collection of items (e.g., a sorted list of integers), how would you search for an element?  Also, what is the time complexity and can you do better?</li>
      <li>Given a recursive function, can you make it into a non-recursive function?</li>
      <li>What is the time complexity (in Big-Oh) of traversing (preorder, postorder, or inorder) a binary search tree?</li>
      <li>A singly linked list is filled a character in each node. Write a function to determine if the linked list is a palindrome.</li>
      <li>Tell me some of the differences between programming language x (e.g., C++) and programming language y (e.g., Java).</li>
      <li>Tell me how you can design…</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li><em>I understand that you have worked on [put project here; bonus if it is a side project]. Explain why you did [some function or task] this way. Can you do better?</em> One purpose of this question is to see candidate’s thinking process.  I also want to see if the candidate can make tradeoffs.  I can also determine candidate’s passion for engineering and development especially if this is a side project.  If the candidate talks about a side project or a research project, great! Look, there are lots of smart people out there. But passionate developers are another breed, very hard to find.  For the latter part of the question, if candidate responds “I don’t know” that is a good thing, not a bad thing.  There is nothing wrong with admitting “I don’t know”: it is a fair and honest answer.  Admitting to not knowing something is always better than bullshitting through the response.</li>
  <li><em>Did you use revision control for the project?</em> A red flag if the answer is “no.”</li>
  <li><em>Do you have any questions for me?</em> Your questions (or lackthereof) will reveal to me how seriously interested are you, how much you really want the job, and if you did your research on the job and on the company.  Serious red flag if the candidate does not have any questions.</li>
</ul>

<p>A few important notes:</p>

<ul>
  <li>A thank you note goes a long way.  Interviewing candidates is time-consuming and tiring.  You don’t believe how few people do this.</li>
  <li>There are so many candidates that look amazing on paper.  However, few candidates have “something to show for it.”  A portfolio of some of your work will set you ahead of the pack.  There is a reason why GitHub has become a de facto resume and your cover letter is essentially toilet paper.</li>
  <li>If you know who your interviewers are, there is nothing creepy about gathering information about them via Google, Facebook, LinkedIn, Twitter, etc.  It is expected.  Doing this means you are “doing your homework.”</li>
  <li>The converse is also true.  Assume that the interviewer(s) will know everything about you.  The interview serves a confirmation of what they already know.</li>
</ul>

<p>If you want more technical job interview questions and preparation, a friend and dear colleague, Robin Kahan, provided this: <a href="http://courses.csail.mit.edu/iap/interview/materials.php" target="_blank">http://courses.csail.mit.edu/iap/interview/materials.php</a></p>

<h3 id="how-do-you-hire">How do you hire?</h3>

<p>Personality is paramount.  Personality will send you very far in life. Your academic or engineering prowness may get you the job but your personality and soft-skills will get you the promotion.  Working with jerks is poisonous, enough said.  I also look for passion and the abilities to listen and learn quickly.</p>

<p>I cannot emphasize this enough but your first impression is critical.  In fact, I can determine if I will hire you within the first 2 - 5 minutes. Many years ago (2006 that is), I was looking for a web development intern.  A young man was referred to me by the director of HR at where I worked.  I will never forget the young man’s magnetic personality when he walked through the front door when I greeted him. During the interview, I realized that he didn’t have the educational background nor the entire skillset I wanted.  But I could easily tell that he was really excited about web design and development, and was eager to learn what was necessary.  So I took a chance on him. It turned out that he would be the best person I’ve hired and perhaps will ever hire.  An extra bonus that the man had the ability to speak to a greater community, audience.  That young man was named Chris Traganos, now a Head of Developer Outreach and Senior Web Developer at Evernote.</p>

<h3 id="can-you-tell-me-where-your-former-students-took-jobs-at-after-graduation">Can you tell me where your former students took jobs at after graduation?</h3>
<p>Sure, this is pretty easy for me to do.  I keep in contact with many of them and I also maintain the <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/groups/Tufts-University-Computer-Science-Alumni-3728282/about" target="_blank">Tufts University Computer Science Alumni Group on LinkedIn</a>.  So here is a list of some of the companies where my students have took jobs at (note: names withheld for obvious reasons):</p>

<ul>
  <li>Amazon</li>
  <li>Apple</li>
  <li>Bloomberg</li>
  <li>BoardVantage</li>
  <li>Box</li>
  <li>Cigital</li>
  <li>Evernote</li>
  <li>Galatea Associates</li>
  <li>Google</li>
  <li>InterSystems</li>
  <li>JumpOffCampus (this company was started in my Web Engineering class in Spring 2010)</li>
  <li>Microsoft</li>
  <li>MIT Lincoln Laboratory</li>
  <li>MojoTech</li>
  <li>Palantir</li>
  <li>Pegasystems</li>
  <li>PopCap Games</li>
  <li>Pubget</li>
  <li>Rockstar Games</li>
  <li>TripAdvisor</li>
  <li>Turbine / WB Games</li>
  <li>Twitter</li>
  <li>Vlingo (now Nuance)</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="how-did-you-get-in-computer-security">How did you get in computer security?</h3>
<p>I took a course on software security with <a href="http://www.cigital.com/~gem/" target="_blank">Gary McGraw</a> at the USENIX Annual Conference in Boston in 2004.  I was also inspired by Professor Ed Felten (Princeton) at the same conference.</p>
