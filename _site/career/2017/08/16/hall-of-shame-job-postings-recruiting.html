  <article class="post-content">
    <p>We constantly hear that cyber security has a serious talent shortage.  It doesn’t help when job descriptions are completely asinine or when recruiting is embarrassingly bad.  This also goes for the tech industry in general.  After reading these tweets from my friend Ed Rojas, I decided to dedicate a hall of shame to this ongoing problem:</p>

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-lang="en"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">Just read this req on LinkedIn: Masters in cybersecurity + 2 high level certs + Risk Analysis, Ethical Hacking, Incident Response, 1/2</p>&mdash; SilverFox (@EdgarR0jas) <a href="https://twitter.com/EdgarR0jas/status/897529699290800128">August 15, 2017</a></blockquote>

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-lang="en"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">Security architect, BCP/DR, Forensic Analyst, SOC design/implementation. Only reply if you meet all requirements. Seriously????? 2/2</p>&mdash; SilverFox (@EdgarR0jas) <a href="https://twitter.com/EdgarR0jas/status/897529959656194048">August 15, 2017</a></blockquote>

<p>Another purpose of this post is to back up the arguments made in the article: <a href="https://www.tripwire.com/state-of-security/risk-based-security-for-executives/connecting-security-to-the-business/there-is-no-cyber-talent-crunch-youre-just-hiring-wrong/">“There Is No Cyber Talent Crunch; You’re Just Hiring Wrong”</a> especially the points of “insisting on over-qualified applicants” and over-filtering.  There are many job candidates who <a href="https://twitter.com/AdrianCohea/status/899503146153656321">“are feeling utterly demoralized for no reason”</a> especially after seeing such job postings.  A message that I want to make clear with this post: don’t disqualify yourself –because the purple squirrel does not exist.</p>

<h1 id="addendum">Addendum</h1>

<p>My friend Rob Graham wrote this:</p>

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-lang="en"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">Remember: a lot of recruiting posts are designed so that nobody can fill them - except for that one foreigner you&#39;ve already decided to hire</p>&mdash; Rob Graham٩(●̮̮̃●̃) (@ErrataRob) <a href="https://twitter.com/ErrataRob/status/898015231309262848">August 17, 2017</a></blockquote>

<p>While there is truth in what Rob wrote, the problem is when recruiters spam the same job description everywhere (e.g., on LinkedIn) which wastes everyone’s time.</p>
